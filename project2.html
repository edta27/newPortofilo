                    <p class="p2">The purpose of this blog is used for an Evangelist to communication
                    with our church member for their need. From what I heard from our evangelist most
                    of their need will be prayer and then the next thing will be finanical support.</p></br>
                    <p>The main user will be our own evangelists from our church. We are currently having about
                    1000+ member from our church and it is really hard to keep track of everyone, especially for
                     the one who we don't see everyweek, it will be very diffcult for us to remember them.
                     Therefore, I have decided to make a very simple E-blog for our evangelist.
                     By the way E stand for Evangelist.</p></br>
                     <p>I notice that you can setup a group in facebook to do the same thing. However,
                      I feel like using facebook itself is a distraction, because when I use facebook I will want
                       to click on something else or looking into other stuff instead. Therefore, I believe a special
                        blog like this will able to bring our church member closer to each other.</p>
